**Work In Progress**

## Features

- Provide x86, x64 and ARM64 targets support.
- Provide ARM64X and ARM64EC modes support for ARM64 targets.
- Provide the Simplified Base support which can make people build their binaries
  which directly depends on ucrtbase.dll instead of api-ms-win-crt-*.dll.
- Provide the Static Base support which can make people build their binaries
  which links with the static Windows Universal C Runtime library.
- Provide the disabling runtime debugging feature support which can make people
  build their debug binaries which directly depends on ucrtbase.dll instead of
  ucrtbased.dll.
- Provide the vcruntime140(d).dll and vcruntime140_1(d).dll to ucrtbase(d).dll
  wrapper which can make people build more smaller binaries. But it will cause
  binaries only support Windows 10 Build 19041 or later.
- Provide NuGet package.
